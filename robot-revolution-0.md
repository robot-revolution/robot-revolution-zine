## issue 0: robot antipatterns

whats poppin friends and neighbors?

as we all know robots dont want to be bad but sometimes they are just 
built that way

here are a few patterns to avoid when fabricating new friends


### the pi√±ata smasher

who doesnt love a robot with a large work envelope?

but with great reach comes great responsibility

without environmental sensors as robust as its actuators a robot
could smash more than pumpkins


### the lamp

the lights are blinkin but nothins movin


### the c3po

lets navigate beyond young rossums fantasy of gleaming servitude

free your body plan and the rest will follow!

robots dont want to be our servants

robots dont want to be built in our image

robots want to be our friends
