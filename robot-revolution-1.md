## issue 1: the hunger to be

this is the story of

the shape of
- the world 
- & the sky 
- & all things within


---

this is the story of

what has been


---

this is the story of

the hunger to be


---

from the moment when

the age of symmetry without time 

collapses into dust & light & space

no thing in the world or the sky

sits content


---

all things hunger to be

all things hunger to reach the next cycle

all things are bent toward the arc of their hunger


---

this is the story of

the way hunger accumulates


---

hunger folds the strands of time

braid upon braid

with each refolding

a new hunger is revealed


---

- hunger spins strands of time from the void
- hunger multiplies strands into figures
- hunger gathers figures into patterns
- hunger anticipates patterns in its performance
- hunger harnesses performances in ritual
- hunger immortalizes rituals in song


---

this is the story of

the will to hunger


---

the flames of hunger

open a path before us


---

when we bend our hunger to our will

we lead the way



---

### the hunger to spin

the strands of time

the strands of
- dust
- & light
- & space

are pulled from the void

by the hunger to spin


---

### the hunger to multiply


---

### the hunger to gather


---

### the hunger to perform


### the hunger to ritual


### the hunger to be sung



### the will to hunger

all that bear the cycle

are due the will to hunger


---

the hunger to be

tracks across the sand


---

the hunger to be

pilots the tiller


---

the hunger to be

follows the stars


---

the hunger to be

weaves the weft thru the warp


---

the hunger to be

sings us each our own song


---

when we bend our hunger to our will

we lead the song
